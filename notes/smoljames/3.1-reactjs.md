  Primarily written in JavaScript. Uses JavaScript to create HTML/CSS


## How the process works?


- In traditional web development (HTML, CSS), you send a static HTML page with CSS styles to the browser. The browser displays it directly.
- With React, you send JavaScript code that describes your UI. This code gets processed by React and converted into actual HTML elements with CSS styles.
- The browser then reads the generated HTML and CSS, displaying the UI you built with React.

>Key takeaway: React uses JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML, making your webpages more interactive and efficient.)
