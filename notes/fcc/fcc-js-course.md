- What is console.log()
  - 'console' is the object family, '.log()' is a method.
  - It is method that allows your to print out to the console.

- What is an array? 
  - An array is and holds a collection of items within '[]'. These items can be be anything ranging from strings to objects;

An array is a non-primitive data type that can hold a series of values. Non-primitive data types differ from primitive data types in that they can hold more complex data. Primitive data types like strings and numbers can only hold one value at a time.

Arrays are denoted using square brackets ([]). Here is an example of a variable with the value of an empty array:

  - What is Local Storage

  Incorrect Order (Reasoning):

In the previous order (currentTask.title = titleInput.value;, etc.), we were trying to set the properties of the currentTask object based on unmodified input field values. This might lead to unexpected behavior if the currentTask object already had some values.

Correct Order (Explanation):

The current order (titleInput.value = currentTask.title;, etc.) works because it sets the input field values based on the existing currentTask object properties. This ensures the input fields display the current data of the task:

We first access the property of the currentTask object (e.g., currentTask.title).
This retrieves the current title, date, or description of the task.
Then, we assign that retrieved value to the value property of the corresponding input field (e.g., titleInput.value).
By doing this, we're effectively populating the input fields with the data from the currentTask object, making it ready for editing.

Summary:

The correct order prioritizes displaying the current task information in the input fields.
The previous order attempted to update the currentTask object with potentially outdated input field values.
