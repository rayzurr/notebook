## Chapter 1
 ### Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App
### Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu
### Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers

**RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)**

* Used for digital displays like webpages.
* Represents colors by mixing Red, Green, and Blue values (0-255).
* Includes an Alpha channel (0.0 to 1.0) to define opacity (transparency). 
* Example: `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)` is red with 50% opacity.

**HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)**

* More intuitive for human understanding.
* Hue (0-360 degrees) represents the color itself (e.g., red, green, blue).
* Saturation (0-100%) defines the color intensity (0% is gray, 100% is full color).
* Lightness (0-100%) controls how light or dark the color is.
* Example: `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)` is a bright red.

**HEX (Hexadecimal)**

* Compact notation for RGB values.
* Uses a 6-digit code preceded by # (e.g., #FF0000 for red).
* Each digit represents the Red, Green, and Blue values (0-F).
* Doesn't support transparency.
* Example: `#FFCC33` is a light orange.
* 4D means (4(invisible 16) + D) = (64 + 13) = 77 // 16 means hexdecimal
* With the exception of FF = means 15 x 15 ??

**Choosing the right format:**

* Use RGBA for digital colors with transparency.
* Use HSL for easier color adjustments based on human perception.
* Use HEX for brevity and compatibility with older systems (though transparency isn't possible).

### Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting

- Imagine the Box Model analogy = item/bubblewrap/box/space between other boxes
content/padding/div/margin

- What is boxing size?
  - The border-box sizing model does the opposite of content-box. The total width of the element, including padding and border, will be the explicit width set. The content of the element will shrink to make room for the padding and border.

- What is `object-fit:cover` property?
  Determines how the image behaves i.e enables correct aspect ratio

### Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz 

A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.

Currently, the img is assuming its default size, which is too large. CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values. For example:

img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
In this example, img elements will have a minimum width of 250px. And as the viewport grows, the image will grow accordingly to be 25 percent of the viewport width.

- 'role' attribute is used to help screen readers users understand and navigate.


- label element and input element are often paired together within when used in forms. Label will have a `for = {name1}` attribute & input will have `id={name1}`. They must have matching 

- Keeping in mind best-practices for form inputs, give each input an appropriate type and name attribute. Then, give the first input a placeholder attribute.

### Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet

![Project Image](image.png)

- `Table` element is paired with the child element of `caption`. Caption will indicate what the table is about. 

- `thead` and `tbody` elements are used to indicate which portion of your table is the header, and which portion contains the primary data or content.

- The `tr` element is used to indicate a table row. The `td` element indicates a data cell, while the `th` element indicates a header cell.

- `:first-of-type` pseudo-selector is used to target the first element matches the selector and conversely `:last-of-type`

- The [attribute="value"] selector targets any element that has an attribute with a specific value.

- The key difference between tr[class="total"] and `tr.total` is that the first will select tr elements where the **only** class is total. The second will select tr elements where the class **includes** total.

- `position` property you can set to **static, absolute, relative, sticky or fixed**. Once you set the position property of the element, you can move the element around by setting a pixel or a percentage value for one or more of the top, right, left, or bottom properties.

- `static` is the default positioning for all elements. If you assign it to an element, you won't be able to move it around with top, right, left, or bottom.


- `sticky` position property is a mix of relative and fixed positioning
