#### The ultimate guide to *A Week as a Software Engineer in NYC + How I Got Here* 

Jacob's story

> *My marketing gig wasn't cutting it anymore.  Sure, it had its moments, but I wasn't feeling creatively fulfilled.  Programming had always been on my radar, but I never dove in headfirst.  Years of starting and stopping finally caught up to me.  This time, I decided to go all in.

Scrimba was my online learning buddy, and I built a portfolio website (ja.com) to show off what I could do.  Job hunting became a remote-first mission since local options for junior devs were scarce. **I applied to 30-40 jobs everyday**

One interview turned out interesting.  The interviewer, bless their heart, didn't have the technical chops to fully assess my skills.  Somehow, I landed the job!  Almost double the pay of my old gig, plus the perk of working remotely?  Mind. Blown.  All this in just a few months after committing to learning to code.

This whole journey underscores two things: recruiters with some technical knowledge are a godsend, and putting yourself out there with a portfolio is key.*

## 3 tips
1. Showcasing your work allows potential employers to see what you've done and understand your thought process behind your decisions.  A simple CV just isn't enough in a technical interview.  You need a portfolio website, like yourname.com, to display your projects. Recruiters actively seek out candidates with online portfolios.  This will benefit you significantly in the recruitment process, potentially putting your application at the top of the pile.

Ultimately, if you're truly determined, you'll find a way to make it happen.
