**RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)**

* Used for digital displays like webpages.
* Represents colors by mixing Red, Green, and Blue values (0-255).
* Includes an Alpha channel (0.0 to 1.0) to define opacity (transparency). 
* Example: `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)` is red with 50% opacity.

**HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)**

* More intuitive for human understanding.
* Hue (0-360 degrees) represents the color itself (e.g., red, green, blue).
* Saturation (0-100%) defines the color intensity (0% is gray, 100% is full color).
* Lightness (0-100%) controls how light or dark the color is.
* Example: `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)` is a bright red.

**HEX (Hexadecimal)**

* Compact notation for RGB values.
* Uses a 6-digit code preceded by # (e.g., #FF0000 for red).
* Each digit represents the Red, Green, and Blue values (0-F).
* Doesn't support transparency.
* Example: `#FFCC33` is a light orange.
* 4D means (4(invisible 16) + D) = (64 + 13) = 77 // 16 means hexdecimal
* With the exception of FF = means 15 x 15 ??

**Choosing the right format:**

* Use RGBA for digital colors with transparency.
* Use HSL for easier color adjustments based on human perception.
* Use HEX for brevity and compatibility with older systems (though transparency isn't possible).
